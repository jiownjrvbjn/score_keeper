# score_keeper
A website score keeper for a ping pong game can be created to track and count the points scored by each player. Here's a general description of how such a score keeper can work:

1. User Interface:
   - The score keeper will have two separate score displays, one for each player, typically labeled as "Player A" and "Player B".
   - Each score display will have a corresponding button or input field to increment the score for that player when clicked or triggered.
   - Additional elements such as a reset button or a timer can also be included depending on the desired functionality.

2. Score Tracking:
   - The score keeper will maintain variables to store the current score for each player.
   - Initially, both scores will be set to zero.
   - Whenever a player scores a point, the corresponding score variable will be updated accordingly.

3. Event Handling:
   - JavaScript will be used to handle user interactions with the score keeper.
   - Event listeners will be set up to detect when a player's score button or input field is clicked or triggered.
   - When an event occurs, a JavaScript function will be executed to increment the corresponding score variable.

4. Display Update:
   - After a score is updated, the score keeper's HTML elements representing the score displays will be updated with the new scores.
   - JavaScript will be used to dynamically update the content of the score displays by modifying the HTML elements' text or value.

By combining HTML and JavaScript, you can create a dynamic score keeper for a ping pong game. The HTML provides the structure and user interface elements, while JavaScript handles the event handling, score tracking, and game logic to make the score keeper functional and interactive.
